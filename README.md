Redstone EDEN

**English** | [ç®€ä½“ä¸­æ–‡](./README.zh-CN.md)


## Undo & Redo

Press Ctrl+Z to immediately undo the previous operation, making it much more convenient to develop redstone machines!
For more information, please check [our wiki page](https://wiki.redenmc.com/Undo-and-Redo).

All blocks, block entities and entities are undoable.
Undo is available only if that change is caused by a player, for example, placing blocks and commands.


## Control the game tick (tick)
Reden provides the `/tick <function>` command to control game ticks conveniently and quickly.

### Function (the `<function>` parameter)
- `freeze` freeze the game tick
- `query` display the current TPS information
- `rate <tps>` adjust TPS (default is `20.0`)
- `sprint <1d|3d|60s|stop>` speed up the game
- `step` execute one game tick forward (only works when the game is frozen)
- `unfreeze` unfreeze the game tick
- `back` go back to the previous tick  ***Planning***


## RVC
> Work in progress

![rvc_list](https://github.com/ArthurZhou/reden-is-what-we-made/assets/89689293/dbab2f3a-0e5e-4103-8003-f283306d62f2)

RVC(Redstone Version Control), provides version history and diff analysis for your machines based on git. Press `R+L` to open RVC screen.

### Update, commit and push
***Notice: DO NOT use hotkey `R+G` to login to Github [Issue #103](https://github.com/zly2006/reden-is-what-we-made/issues/103)***

If your Reden account has been linked with GitHub(You can link it [here](https://redenmc.com/home/edit)), RVC can upload your machines to GitHub. 

RVC supports subregions and submodules, so you can use other people's work in your own creations.


For the first-time use, you need to log in to your Reden account. After logging in, you will see the following:

Then, just work with it like any other git repos:

![rvc_git_funcs](https://github.com/ArthurZhou/reden-is-what-we-made/assets/89689293/de014ed2-e7b9-44d8-b100-9ab9d54523c4)

### Block selection
RVC brings a totally new way of selecting blocks that is much easier.

You can hold a blaze rod in your hand, then left click to select a group of blocks, and right click to ignore.

## RDebugger
> Work in progress

Micro-timing analysis and simulation: block update breakpoints (NC, PP, CU, BE), BED debugger, step-by-step update, step-by-step tick, update reset

## Our Wishes

Provide a one-stop working environment for redstone machine developers and become the best redstone debugging and teaching tool.

## Other Features

+ Command Hotkeys: `Super Right -> runCommand` use masa-style hotkeys to run commands
+ Force Sync Entity Pos: `Micro Ticking -> toggleForceEntityPosSync` force sync entity pos to clients, maybe useful when you freeze the game
+ No Time Out: `General -> noTimeout` disable timeout on clients, if you are debugging the server, you probably need this
+ Item Shadowing Detector: carpet `redenDebuggerItemShadow` Detect if there are shadowed items in the inventory, wip, **it will support to disable operations that may break the link in the future**
+ Structure Block Hotkey: `Ctrl+S` to save and `Ctrl+L` to load for you last interacted struct block.

## Bug fixes

+ carpet `fixInvisibleShadowingItems`: fix invisible shadowing item entity, for more information, check [Igna's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSOSWHIg7Mk)

## Build

Just run `./gradlew build` in the root directory of the project.

## Debugging

Debug Properties:

| Property Name                     | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `reden.transformer.printBytecode` | Print final bytecode to stdout. This process runs at mixin postApply stage. |
| `reden.transformer.export.pre`    | Export transformed class. This process runs at mixin preApply stage.        |
