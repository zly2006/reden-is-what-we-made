Redstone EDEN

**English** | [ç®€ä½“ä¸­æ–‡](./README.zh-CN.md)

## Undo & Redo

Press Ctrl+Z to immediately undo the previous operation, making it much more convenient to develop redstone machines!
For more information, please check [our wiki page](https://wiki.redenmc.com/Undo-and-Redo).

All blocks, block entities and entities are undoable.
Undo is available only if that change is caused by a player, for example, placing blocks and commands.

## RVC
> Work in progress

RVC(Redstone Version Control), provides change history and diff analysis for your machines based on git.

RVC can upload your machines to GitHub if you have bound your GitHub account at https://redenmc.com.
RVC supports subregions and submodules, so you can use other people's work in your own creations.

RVC brings a totally new way of selecting blocks that is much easier.
You can hold a blaze rod in your hand, then left click to select a group of blocks, and right click to ignore.

## RDebugger
> Work in progress

Micro-timing analysis and simulation: block update breakpoints (NC, PP, CU, BE), BED debugger, step-by-step update, step-by-step tick, update reset

## Our Wishes

Provide a one-stop working environment for redstone machine developers and become the best redstone debugging and teaching tool.

## Other Features

+ Command Hotkeys: `Super Right -> runCommand` use masa-style hotkeys to run commands
+ Force Sync Entity Pos: `Micro Ticking -> toggleForceEntityPosSync` force sync entity pos to clients, maybe useful when you freeze the game
+ No Time Out: `General -> noTimeout` disable timeout on clients, if you are debugging the server, you probably need this
+ Item Shadowing Detector: carpet `redenDebuggerItemShadow` Detect if there are shadowed items in the inventory, wip, **it will support to disable operations that may break the link in the future**
+ Structure Block Hotkey: `Ctrl+S` to save and `Ctrl+L` to load for you last interacted struct block.

## Bug fixes

+ carpet `fixInvisibleShadowingItems`: fix invisible shadowing item entity, for more information, check [Igna's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSOSWHIg7Mk)

## Build

Just run `./gradlew build` in the root directory of the project.

## Debugging

Debug Properties:

| Property Name                     | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `reden.transformer.printBytecode` | Print final bytecode to stdout. This process runs at mixin postApply stage. |
| `reden.transformer.export.pre`    | Export transformed class. This process runs at mixin preApply stage.        |
